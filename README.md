# Classic Arcade Game Clone
## Game Functions
Error Free - The game functions correctly and runs error free
* Player can not move off screen
* Vehicles cross the screen
* Vehicle-player collision resets the game
* Something happens when player wins

## Object-Oriented Code
Object Oriented Code - Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.

## Documentation
README - A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.

Comments - Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do.

Code Quality - Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html).

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
Provide additional functionality to the game beyond minimum requirements, for example:
* Add collectible items on screen
* Multiple vehicle types
* Timed games
* Be creative!
