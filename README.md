# Classic Arcade Game Clone
## Project Overview
I will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

## Installation and Running the Game
Clone the GitHub repository and open index.html
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/abdullahaalam/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git
```

## How to Start
* Play it here! [Classic Arcade Game Clone](https://abdullahaalam.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)

## How to Play
* The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
* Use the arrow keys or the "WASD" keys on your keyboard to move the character (up, left, down, right).
* The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.
* Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
